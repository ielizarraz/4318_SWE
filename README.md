Software Engineering Class

In this class, we learned primarily about theoreticals in software engineering and the history of software engineering. 
Although that was the case, we still had weekly homeworks and projects that needed to be compeleted in whatever language of our choice. 
For the majority of projects, I had opted to work with C#, and C++. 
For our final, team based project, we created a Microsoft Word Add in that utilized JS, HTML, and CSS in order to create a fairly simple application.
